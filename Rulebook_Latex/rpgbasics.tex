If you already know how to play tabletop RPGs, you can probably skip this section. If you don't, welcome! We hope this will be far from the last one you'll play.

The game is a collaborative story told by the players with the help of the \gmLong\, (\gm). The players navigate characters through the universe that the \gm\, creates. The players don't play against each other, and definitely don't play against the \gm , nor does the \gm\, try to at as an enemy of the players. They all negotiate the story together.
