\section{Hello, world!}
This is an example section of the book. It has a few subsections and some other things, mostly to test out formatting and styles.

\subsection{An example subsection}
This is a subsection that has a certain amount of content. Both the section above and this subsection, and, indeed, every section and subsection in each document, should automatically tile themselves and appear in the table of contents. If they do not, something has gone wrong. \LaTeX is pretty easy to use once you get some basics down, so I'd encourage you to search up some examples, poke through the existing sections to see how things work, look up what you don't, and check Stack Overflow often for questions you may have.

\subsection{More info}
\LaTeX is a typesetting language originally designed by Donald Knuth in order to typset his book, "The Art of Computer Programming". It has become an invaluable tool for people all over the world, especially scientists and mathemetitians. I thought it might be easy and on-theme to typeset this whole rulebook in \LaTeX.
