SYLETHI
An uneducated observer may think that the Sylethi have no time for history. 
After all, the various tribes and cults are too busy combating one another, worshipping their myriad of gods, and desperately trying to survive the arid wastes of Dressel to look fondly at the past. 
This observation would be incorrect. The Sylethi encorporate history into everything they do. From the gods they worship (most of whom are ancestors transendent*) 
to the wars they fight (enacting vengence for slights eons old), history permeates Sylethi culture in a way that many more "advanced" cultures can only dream about. 
Simply living is a historical fact to the Sylethi, who believe everyone died in the last universe, and we are simply reenacting the past in the present. 
A visit to Dressel to live among the Sylethi will put reality in perspective for any historian, amatuer or professional. One just has to survive the acid-storms!

*For more reading into Sylethi religion, read "Enamored with Grandpa" by Sarkesen Ridly. Despite the rather journalistic title, and some gross inaccuraies about Sylethi female sexuality, the text is the benchmark of Sylethi religion.
